## Key Features

### 1. **Data Integration**
- Supports over 90 built-in connectors for diverse data sources, including Azure Blob Storage, SQL Server, Snowflake, Salesforce, and more.
- Enables seamless data movement between on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments.

### 2. **Data Transformation**
- Provides code-free data transformation using data flows.
- Supports custom transformations with Azure Functions, Data Bricks, or custom Python scripts.

### 3. **Orchestration and Automation**
- Enables complex workflow orchestration through pipelines.
- Supports triggers for event-based automation (e.g., time, blob events).

### 4. **Scalability and Performance**
- Offers dynamic scaling to handle big data workloads efficiently.
- Supports parallel processing for high-performance data pipelines.

### 5. **Monitoring and Management**
- Built-in monitoring dashboard for real-time tracking of pipeline execution.
- Integration with Azure Monitor for advanced diagnostics.

## Core Concepts

### **1. Pipelines**
- A pipeline is a logical grouping of activities that perform a specific task.
- Pipelines can ingest, prepare, transform, and move data.

### **2. Activities**
- Activities are individual tasks within a pipeline (e.g., Copy Activity, Data Flow Activity).

### **3. Linked Services**
- Represent connection strings to data sources or compute services.

### **4. Datasets**
- Define the structure of your data within your data stores.

### **5. Integration Runtimes**
- Bridge between Azure Data Factory and data sources.
- Types: Azure, Self-hosted, and Azure SSIS.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. **Data Ingestion**
- Load data from on-premises SQL Server to Azure Data Lake Storage.
- Automate file ingestion from SFTP servers.

### 2. **Data Transformation**
- Perform ETL processes with mapping data flows.
- Process large datasets using Spark clusters in Azure Databricks.

### 3. **Data Orchestration**
- Schedule and automate end-to-end workflows involving multiple systems.
- Chain activities with dependencies and error handling.

## Architecture

### **High-Level Workflow**
1. **Source Connection**: Connect to diverse data sources using linked services.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Use pipelines to copy data into a central repository.
3. **Data Transformation**: Process data with activities and data flows.
4. **Data Delivery**: Move transformed data to analytics or storage services.
5. **Monitoring**: Track pipeline execution through the monitoring dashboard.
